# Getting and Cleaning Data: Project
## Introduction

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone 
Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent 
data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where 
the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Objective

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
and each subject.

## Description on the files
*codebook.rmd:* Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the original data.  
*run_analysis.R:* Contains all the R code used to clean the original data obtained online. Steps are clearly explained in the 
script.  
*tidy.txt:* The final results containing the mean of each desired variable for each activity and each subject.
